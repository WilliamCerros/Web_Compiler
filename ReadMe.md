This program acts as a compiler where we can assign .mp3 files to variables. Just in time assignment is supported along with variable reassignment. In addition, in the case of an error where the user calls a variable without having defined it first, the user will be prompted to specify a .mp3 file for the variable. The program is loaded with demonstrations of variable assignment, just in time assignment, variable reassignment, and error handling of undefined variables. Once submit is clicked, the program will analyze every line within the first textarea. Pre-processing these lines will allow us to check for undefined variables that are being used. The user is then given the opportunity to specify a music file for the variable. Program uses RegEx to handle variable assignment. The section titled Compiled Code will output HTML/JS code that can be run to reproduce the Music Generator program. Program comes preloaded with a script that will demonstrate the aforementioned functions.
